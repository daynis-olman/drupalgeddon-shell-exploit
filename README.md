# drupalgeddon-shell-exploit for Drupal 8.0.0


### A Bash script to exploit the Drupalgeddon2 vulnerability (CVE-2018-7600) in Drupal websites. This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by exploiting a flaw in the Drupal core.

## Requirements
This script requires the following tools to be installed on the system:

- Bash shell
- curl
- Usage
To use this script, run the following command from the terminal:

bash
Copy code
./drupalgeddon2.sh -h <url> -c <command>
where:

<url> is the URL of the target Drupal website.
<command> is the command to be executed on the server.
For example:

bash
Copy code
./exploit.sh -h http://www.drupal-test.daynisolman.com -c 'ls -la'
This will exploit the Drupal vulnerability on the website http://www.example.com and execute the command ls -la on the server.
